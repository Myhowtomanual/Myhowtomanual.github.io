			To begin, the name of our site is titled, my how to manual. This site was establish in 2016 by Kris Kennedy, Vikash Dookie, Matthew Gunai,
			Karishma Baboolal and Rick Mohammed, as a part of our web design final project. My how to manual is a site for all the times you’ve thought “I wish I knew how to…”
			or “where can I watch a video about….” Our site offers high-quality, expert-hosted information and videos on topics ranging from arts and craft, education, food, 
			sports and fitness, tech and gadgets, recreation, health and relationships just to name a few. Want to know how to travel via maxi taxi from Port of Spain to Arima? 
			Or the trick to dealing with a bad kisser? How about learning to dance like Beyoncé? Or sing like Machel Montano? Thinking about making a Chicken Pelau? Or deciding 
			on if you need to add more salt in your Callaloo? How about learning to juju on that beat? Or tell that special person, “I love you” in different languages? We got you. 
			These are just a handful of the many that my how to manual can teach you. Learning is simple because answers are straightforward and demonstrations are clear so, when you 
			come to us to learn something new or solve a problem you’re getting trusted answers directly from someone who know what they’re talking about. Not to mention with new videos 
			and information being uploaded constantly, there’s always something new to discover. With my how to manual we’re re-imagining the way people find expert advice and answers online, 
			our site is what you’d have if life came with illustrated instructions.
